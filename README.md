# Zoid

An incredibly lightweight and simplified shell, Zoid, is being developed as a proof-of-concept for an Operating Systems course. It does not aim to achieve POSIX compliance or include all the typical features found in most shells.

## How to Run

To run Zoid, follow these steps:

1. Execute `make` to build the project.
2. Run `./zoid` to start the Zoid shell.

## Development State

Zoid is currently not actively under development. However, if you're interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to contact me for more information or submit a pull request directly.
